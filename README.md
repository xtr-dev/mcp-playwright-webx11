# Playwright MCP Server with noVNC Display

A Docker Compose setup that runs the Microsoft Playwright MCP server with a virtual X11 display accessible via noVNC in your web browser.

## Features

- **Playwright MCP Server**: Browser automation via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Headed Browser Mode**: See the browser running in real-time
- **noVNC Web Interface**: View the browser display from any web browser
- **Reusable Architecture**: Persistent Playwright service that can be accessed via SSE or stdio
- **stdio-to-SSE Proxy**: Bridge between stdio-based MCP clients and the SSE endpoint

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Start the persistent Playwright + noVNC service:

```bash
docker compose up -d playwright-display
```

2. Access the services:
   - **noVNC Web UI**: http://localhost:6080
   - **MCP SSE Endpoint**: http://localhost:3080/sse

### MCP Client Configuration

**stdio transport** (recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=playwright-network",
        "mcp-playwright-novnc:latest",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "http://playwright-display:3080/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**SSE transport** (direct connection):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable        | Default  | Description                         |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `SCREEN_WIDTH`  | 1920     | Virtual screen width in pixels      |
| `SCREEN_HEIGHT` | 1080     | Virtual screen height in pixels     |
| `SCREEN_DEPTH`  | 24       | Color depth                         |
| `MCP_PORT`      | 3080     | MCP server port                     |
| `MCP_BROWSER`   | chromium | Browser (chromium, firefox, webkit) |

## Docker Compose Configuration

The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file with the persistent Playwright + noVNC service.

The Docker image also includes a `mcp-proxy` script that bridges stdio to SSE, allowing MCP clients using stdio transport to connect to the running Playwright service.

**Proxy Usage**: The `mcp-proxy` command accepts the SSE URL as a command-line argument:

```bash
mcp-proxy <SSE_URL>
```

You can also use the `PLAYWRIGHT_SSE_URL` environment variable as a fallback.

You can customize the environment variables in the compose file or via a `.env` file:

```env
SCREEN_WIDTH=1920
SCREEN_HEIGHT=1080
SCREEN_DEPTH=24
MCP_BROWSER=chromium
```

## Building Locally

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker compose build

# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f playwright-display
```

## Testing the Proxy

```bash
# Test the proxy connection
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | \
  docker run --rm -i --network=playwright-network \
  mcp-playwright-novnc:latest mcp-proxy http://playwright-display:3080/sse
```

## Architecture

The setup consists of a single Docker container running:

- **Playwright MCP Server** (port 3080): Accepts browser automation commands via SSE or stdio
- **Chromium Browser**: Runs on a virtual display (Xvfb)
- **noVNC Web Interface** (port 6080): View the browser in real-time via your web browser
- **mcp-proxy**: Bridges stdio-based MCP clients to the SSE endpoint

## Available MCP Tools

The Playwright MCP server provides browser automation tools including:

- `browser_navigate` - Navigate to a URL
- `browser_click` - Click on elements
- `browser_type` - Type text into inputs
- `browser_fill_form` - Fill form fields
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Capture screenshots
- `browser_snapshot` - Capture accessibility snapshot
- `browser_tabs` - Manage browser tabs
- `browser_close` - Close the browser
- `browser_evaluate` - Evaluate JavaScript
- `browser_console_messages` - Get console messages
- And many more...

## Using Pre-built Images

Pre-built images are available from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/xtr-dev/mcp-playwright-novnc:latest
```

### Complete Setup Example

**1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**

```yaml
services:
  playwright-display:
    image: ghcr.io/xtr-dev/mcp-playwright-novnc:latest
    container_name: playwright-display
    ports:
      - "6080:6080"  # noVNC web interface
      - "3080:3080"  # MCP SSE endpoint
    environment:
      - SCREEN_WIDTH=1920
      - SCREEN_HEIGHT=1080
      - MCP_BROWSER=chromium
    networks:
      - playwright-network

networks:
  playwright-network:
    name: playwright-network
```

**2. Start the service:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**3. Configure your MCP client:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=playwright-network",
        "ghcr.io/xtr-dev/mcp-playwright-novnc:latest",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "http://playwright-display:3080/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Access the browser display:**

Open http://localhost:6080 in your web browser to see the Playwright browser in action.
